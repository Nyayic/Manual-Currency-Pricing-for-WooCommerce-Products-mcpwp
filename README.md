# Custom Currency Pricing for WooCommerce Products

Custom Currency Pricing for WooCommerce Products is a plugin that allows you to add custom currency pricing options to WooCommerce products. With this plugin, you can specify different prices for each currency. This is useful if you want to sell your products in multiple currencies or if you want to override the default currency set in your WooCommerce settings.

## Installation

1. Upload the `custom-currency-pricing-for-woocommerce-products` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Edit a product and you'll see a new option for custom currency pricing.

## Usage

### Custom Currency Pricing

To set different prices for different currencies for a product:

1. Edit the product in the WordPress dashboard.
2. Scroll down to the "Custom Currency Pricing" field in the "Product Data" section.
3. Click the "Add Row" button to add a new currency and price.
4. Select a currency code from the drop-down list in the "Currency" field.
5. Enter a price for the currency in the "Price" field. The price should be entered as a decimal value with a period as the decimal separator, e.g. "10.99".
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each currency you want to add.
7. Save the product.

The prices you set for each currency will be used instead of the default product price when a customer selects that currency on your store.
